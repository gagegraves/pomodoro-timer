# Pomodoro Timer
This is a react web-app prject for my thinkful course.
This project can be used as a work/break timer to increase productivity, using the pomodoro method.
The app allows you to choose how long you want to work or break, and it's all created in React using JSX.
This project helped ingraine my JSX skills and acted as a good introduction project to React.
